Now, need to check which of these are Pareto optimal. Let's go through each and see if any other payoff pair dominates it.

Starting with 1: (5,3). Check if any other pair has both payoffs ≥ 5 and 3. Let's see:

Looking at other pairs:

- (5,7) in 5 and 6: higher column payoff. So (5,7) dominates (5,3) because column is higher, row same.

Similarly, (7,3) in 3 and 16: higher row, same column. So (7,3) dominates (5,3).

So (5,3) is not Pareto optimal.

2: (4,5). Check if any other pair has row ≥4 and column ≥5.

Looking at (5,7) in 5 and 6: higher in both. So (5,7) dominates (4,5). Also (6,6) in 14: higher in both. (7,5) in 15 and 19: higher row, same column. (6,7) in 20: higher row and column. So (4,5) is dominated.

3: (7,3). Check if any other pair with row ≥7 and column ≥3.

(7,3) is row=7, column=3. Are there any other pairs with row≥7 and column≥3?

Looking at (7,5) in 15,19: higher column, same row. (7,5) dominates (7,3). Also, (6,7) in 20: higher column, lower row. Doesn't dominate. So (7,5) dominates (7,3). So (7,3) is not Pareto optimal.

4: (3,4). Any pair with row≥3 and column≥4. Let's see:

Many pairs have higher row and column. For example, (4,5), (5,7), etc. So (3,4) is dominated.

5: (5,7). Check if any other pair dominates this. Need a pair with row≥5 and column≥7. (6,7) in 20: row=6 ≥5, column=7. So (6,7) dominates (5,7). Therefore, (5,7) is not Pareto optimal. Also, check if (5,7) is dominated by others. (6,7) is better in row, same column. So (5,7) is dominated.

6: (5,7) same as 5, so already considered. But since 6 is the same payoff as 5, but in pick, blast off. Wait, actually, no. Wait, (5,7) is in both flee, post online and pick, blast off. So entries 5 and 6 are both (5,7). So both of these are dominated by (6,7) in entry 20. So (5,7) is not Pareto optimal.

7: (3,7). Check if any pair with row≥3 and column≥7. (6,7) in 20: row=6 ≥3, column=7. So (6,7) dominates (3,7). So (3,7) is dominated.

8: (7,2). Check for row≥7, column≥2. (7,3) in 3 and 16, (7,5) in 15,19, (7,5) would have higher column. So (7,5) dominates (7,2). Also, (6,7) in 20 dominates in column. But (7,2) has higher row. However, (7,5) has same row, higher column. So (7,5) dominates (7,2). So (7,2) is not Pareto optimal.

9: (2,6). Check if any pair with row≥2 and column≥6. (6,6) in 14: higher row and same column. (6,6) dominates (2,6). Also, (6,7) in 20: higher row and column. So (2,6) is dominated.

10: (6,2). Check for row≥6 and column≥2. (7,2) in 8, (7,3) in 3,16, (7,5), etc. (7,2) has higher row, same column. So (7,2) dominates (6,2). Also, (6,3) in 12, etc. But since (7,2) is higher row, same column, (6,2) is dominated.

11: (3,5). Check if any pair with row≥3, column≥5. (4,5) in 2, (5,7) in 5,6, (6,6) in 14, (7,5) in 15,19, (6,7) in 20. For example, (4,5) has higher row and same column, so (4,5) dominates (3,5). But (4,5) is itself dominated by (5,7), etc. But regardless, (3,5) is dominated by (4,5).

12: (6,3). Check if any pair with row≥6, column≥3. (7,3) in 3,16: higher row, same column. (7,3) dominates (6,3). Also, (6,6) in 14: same row, higher column. So (6,6) dominates (6,3). Therefore, (6,3) is dominated.

13: (2,3). Check for row≥2, column≥3. Many pairs dominate this, like (3,5), (4,5), etc. So (2,3) is dominated.

14: (6,6). Check if any pair dominates this. Need row≥6 and column≥6. Looking at all pairs:

(7,5) has row=7 ≥6, column=5 <6: doesn't dominate.

(6,7) in 20: row=6, column=7. So (6,7) has same row, higher column. Thus, (6,7) dominates (6,6). Therefore, (6,6) is dominated.

15: (7,5). Check if any pair dominates this. Need row≥7 and column≥5. The only row with 7 is row=7 in (7,3), (7,5), (7,2), etc. So (7,5) is the highest row. For column=5, looking for higher column. (6,7) has column=7, but row=6 <7. So (6,7) doesn't dominate (7,5). Similarly, (5,7) has lower row. So (7,5) is not dominated. Wait, (6,7) has higher column but lower row. So neither dominates the other. So (7,5) is a candidate for Pareto optimal.

16: (7,3). Check if any pair dominates. (7,5) in 15,19: higher column. So (7,5) dominates (7,3). So (7,3) is dominated.

17: (2,6). Already checked, dominated by (6,6) and (6,7).

18: (6,2). Already dominated.

19: (7,5). Same as 15. Check again. As above, (7,5) is not dominated by any other pair except perhaps (6,7) but no. So (7,5) is Pareto optimal.

20: (6,7). Check if any pair dominates this. Need row≥6 and column≥7. The highest column is 7, so column can't be higher. For row, is there a pair with row≥6 and column≥7? (6,7) is the only one. So (6,7) is Pareto optimal.

So after checking all, the Pareto optimal outcomes are:

- (7,5) in 15 and 19 (provoke, post online and ignore, shut down)

- (6,7) in 20 (ignore, post online)

Wait, but let's make sure. Let's check each of these:

For (7,5): Are there any other pairs where both payoffs are higher? If another pair has row>7, but max row is 7. Column>5: the only higher column is 6 or 7. (6,7) has column=7 but row=6 <7. So (7,5) and (6,7) don't dominate each other. So both are Pareto optimal.

Also, (6,7): Is there any pair with row≥6 and column≥7? Only (6,7) itself. So (6,7) is Pareto optimal.

Any others? Let me check again.

Wait, (6,7) is in 20: ignore, post online. (7,5) is in provoke, post online (15) and ignore, shut down (19). Are there any other pairs that are not dominated?

Wait, let's check (5,7) in 5 and 6: dominated by (6,7).

(6,6) in 14: dominated by (6,7).

(7,5) and (6,7) are the only ones not dominated. Let me check if there's another pair that's not dominated.

Wait, (7,5) in 15 and 19: row=7, column=5. Any other pair that isn't dominated?

For example, (5,7) is dominated by (6,7). (6,7) is not dominated by anything else. (7,5) is not dominated by anything else.

### Pareto Optimality

A strategy profile is Pareto optimal if no other profile makes at least one player better off without making another worse off. After comparing all 20 strategy profiles, the following are identified as Pareto optimal:
1. **Provoke and Post Online** with payoff (7, 5)
2. **Ignore and Shut Down** with payoff (7, 5)
3. **Ignore and Post Online** with payoff (6, 7)
These profiles are on the Pareto front because their payoffs are not dominated by any other profiles.

### Nash Equilibria

A Nash equilibrium occurs when no player can benefit by changing their strategy while the others keep theirs unchanged. After checking each strategy profile for pure strategy Nash equilibria:
- For each cell in the matrix, we check if the row player's payoff is the maximum in its column and the column player's payoff is the maximum in its row.
- No pure strategy Nash equilibria are found because for every strategy profile, at least one player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.

### Final Answer
**Pareto Optima and Front Strategies:**
- $\boxed{(\text{provoke}, \text{post online})}$ with payoff (7, 5)
- $\boxed{(\text{ignore}, \text{shut down})}$ with payoff (7, 5)
- $\boxed{(\text{ignore}, \text{post online})}$ with payoff (6, 7)

**Nash Equilibria:**
- $\boxed{\text{None}}$ (in pure strategies)
