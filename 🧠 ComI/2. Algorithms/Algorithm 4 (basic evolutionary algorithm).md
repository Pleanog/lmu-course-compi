### ELI5

This algorithm represents a **population-based optimization process**, meaning it uses a group of candidates (a population) to search for the best solution to a problem. Over time, the population is updated by applying two main steps: **selection** and **variation**.

The idea is simple:

1. Start with a population $X_t$ at time $t$.
2. Apply **variation** (mutations, crossover, etc.) to introduce changes to the population.
3. Use **selection** to pick the best candidates for the next population, $X_{t+1}$.
4. Repeat until the algorithm converges or reaches a stopping condition.

### Definitions of Components:

1. **Population** ($X_t$):  
    A set of candidate solutions at time $t$. The size of the population remains constant over time, meaning $\lvert X_{t+1} \rvert = \lvert X_t \rvert$.
    
2. **Variation** ($\text{variation}(X_t)$):  
    A function (possibly randomized) that modifies the population $X_t$ to introduce diversity. This could involve techniques like:
    d
    sdfs
    s
    df

    - **Mutation**: Slightly altering candidates.
    - **Crossover**: Combining features from multiple candidates.
3. **Selection** ($\text{selection}(X_t \uplus \text{variation}(X_t))$):  
    A function that chooses which candidates from the combined pool of $X_t$ and its variations will form the next generation $X_{t+1}$. The goal is to ensure the population moves towards better solutions.
    
4. **Update Rule**:  
    The new population $X_{t+1}$ is generated as:
    
    $Xt+1=\selection (Xt⊎variation(Xt)),X_{t+1} = \text{selection}(X_t \uplus \text{variation}(X_t)),Xt+1​=selection(Xt​⊎variation(Xt​))$,
    
    where $\uplus$ denotes the union of the current population and its variations.
    
    - It ensures $\lvert X_{t+1} \rvert = \lvert X_t \rvert$ (the population size stays the same).

### Summary of the Process:

1. Start with an initial population $X_0$.
2. At each step $t$:
    - Generate new candidates by applying **variation** to $X_t$.
    - Combine the original population $X_t$ with its variations.
    - Use **selection** to form the new population $X_{t+1}$.
3. Continue updating until convergence or stopping criteria (like a maximum number of iterations).

### Key Notes for Study:

- The population size is constant: $\lvert X_{t+1} \rvert = \lvert X_t \rvert$.
- Both **selection** and **variation** can be **randomized** or **non-deterministic**.
- The algorithm evolves the population over time by balancing **exploration** (through variation) and **exploitation** (through selection).

This algorithm is the foundation of **evolutionary computation**, used in optimization problems to simulate the process of natural evolution.
