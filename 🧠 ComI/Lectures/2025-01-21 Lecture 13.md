# **Prisoner's Dilemma**

In game theory, the **Prisoner's Dilemma** is a classic example that illustrates why two rational individuals might not cooperate, even when it appears that doing so would be in their best interest. This paradox arises because each player faces an incentive to defect (betray the other), regardless of the other's decision.**

#### Payoff Matrix:
- **Cooperate (C)** vs **Defect (D)**
    - If both players cooperate (C,C), the reward is $−1$ for each.
    - If both defect (D,D), the penalty is $−2$ for each.
    - If one cooperates (C) and the other defects (D), the defector receives $0$, while the cooperator receives $-3$.

##### Implications:
- The Prisoner's Dilemma is a fundamental problem in **multi-agent systems** and **reinforcement learning**, as it showcases the tension 

**Difference to Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS)**:
- The Prisoner’s Dilemma is **not a zero-sum game**, as cooperation benefits both players, whereas RPS is a **zero-sum game**, where gains and losses balance out completely.

# **Pure Coordination**

In pure coordination games, players benefit by coordinating their actions, and the specific choice is irrelevant as long as both players agree. An example is deciding which side of the road to drive on:

#### Payoff Matrix:
- Whether driving on the left or right side of the road, the critical factor is that both players make the **same decision**.

The goal is **mutual agreement**, where the payoffs depend only on coordination, not the individual choices.

# **Pareto-Optimal Strategies**

In the context of multi-objective games, **Pareto-optimal strategies** form the **Pareto front** (as defined in [[Definition 17]]). These are strategies where no player can improve their outcome without making another player worse off.

#### **Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS)**
This game is defined in [[2025-01-14 Lecture 12]]
- **Zero-Sum Game**: **No strategy dominates another**, and **all strategies are Pareto-optimal**. This is because any gain for one player is exactly balanced by a loss for the other.
- **Key Insights**: 
	- There are no pareto-dominating-strategies!
	- Thus all the strategies are then pareto-optimal!
	- Conclusion: **Every nulll-sum-game is allready pareto-optimal.**

#### **Prisoner's Dilemma**
- Pareto-optimal strategies: {C, C}, {C,D} and {D,C}.
- {C,C} is the optimal collective outcome ($−2$ total loss), but individual incentives to defect risk leading to {D,D} ($−4$ total loss).
- **Danger of Defection**: While defecting may seem advantageous individually, it leads to worse outcomes for both players collectively

*Even while {C,C} has the smaller overall lost points $(-2)$, this is not the optima. Every player tries to gain the most for himself. For a player it would be better to get from {C,C} to {C,D} but since this can lead to {D,D} (as we don#t know the other players actions beforehand) it is "dangerous". But {D,C} or {C,D} are not dominated by {C,C} for any player.*

#### **Pure Coordination (Which-Side-to-Drive-On)**
- Pareto-optimal strategies are {L,L} and {R,R}, as $(1,1)$ dominates $(−5,−5)$ in all cases.
- **Insight**: These strategies ensure mutual benefit, highlighting the importance of coordination over individual preference.

# **Nash Equilibria**

A **Nash equilibrium** represents a state where no player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy. It marks the "end of all mind games," where players have no incentive to deviate.

#### **Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS)**

- **Dynamic Equilibrium**: Players continuously adapt, as each choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors) is countered by another.
- The Nash equilibrium occurs in a **mixed strategy**:
    - Players randomize their moves equally among {R,P,S}\{R, P, S\}{R,P,S}, ensuring no player has a predictable advantage.
    - So the **Nash-Equilibrium** would be: $\pi = \{R,P,S\}$ 
- **Key Insight**: Randomization is the only stable strategy when no prior information about the opponent’s move exists.

**Playing the mind-game:**
1. the other player chooses 
	- rock --> i choose paper
	- paper --> i choose scissors
	- scissors --> i choose stone
2. i choose: 
	- rock --> other player chooses paper
	- paper --> other player chooses scissors
	- scissors --> other player chooses stone
There are no overlaps int the strategies here since there is allways a winnins move where one beats the other.

#### **Prisoner's Dilemma**

- The Nash equilibrium is {D,D}, as defecting is the rational choice for both players to avoid the worst-case scenario $(−3)$.
- **Conflict of Interest**:
    - While {C,C} minimizes collective loss, the incentive to defect undermines cooperation.
    - This highlights the divergence between **individual rationality** and **collective optimality**.
-  **The non-pareto-optimal strategy is the nash-equilibrium.**

---
#### **Pure Coordination (Which-Side-to-Drive-On)**

- Nash equilibria: {L,L} and {R,R}.
- **Rationale**: Once both players select the same side, no incentive exists to deviate.

# **Finding Nash Equilibria**

Identifying Nash equilibria can be computationally expensive, particularly in complex multi-agent systems with numerous strategies. For practical purposes, heuristic or approximate methods are often employed to reduce computational costs.
