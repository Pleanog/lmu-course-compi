> [!CITE] **Definition 19 (nash equilibrium)**
> Let $(G, A, T, \chi)$ be a normal-form game played for a single iteration. A joint strategy $\pi$ is a **Nash equilibrium** if and only if, for all agents $G^{[i]}$, it holds that $\pi^{[i]}$ is the **best response** to $\pi^{[-i]}$.

### ELI5:

Imagine you and a group of friends are playing a game. A **Nash equilibrium** happens when everyone is making the **best possible move** they can, **given what everyone else is doing**. At this point, no one has any reason to change their strategy because changing wouldn’t make them do any better.

### Explanation of the Components:

1. **$(G, A, T, \chi)$:**
    - This represents the setup of the game:
        - $G$: The group of players (agents) in the game.
        - $A$: The set of all possible actions players can take.
        - $T$: The rules of the game that determine what happens when players choose their actions.
        - $\chi$: The outcome function that tells each player how well they are doing (their "score" or "payoff").
2. **$\pi$:**
    - This is the **joint strategy**, meaning a set of strategies that each player decides to follow.
3. **$\pi^{[i]}$:**
    - This is the strategy chosen by a specific player $i$.
4. **$\pi^{[-i]}$:**
    - This represents the strategies chosen by **all the other players** except player $i$.
5. **Best Response:**
    - A strategy $\pi^{[i]}$ is a **best response** if it’s the smartest choice for player $i$, given what all the other players are doing ($\pi^{[-i]}$). This means player $i$ is acting in their best interest based on the actions of others.
6. **Nash Equilibrium:**
    - A joint strategy $\pi$ is a Nash equilibrium if **everyone’s strategy** is the best response to what everyone else is doing. At this point, no one can improve their score by changing their strategy alone.

### Explanation:

In game theory and AI, the **Nash equilibrium** is a critical concept for understanding multi-agent systems. It describes a stable state where **every agent is optimizing their actions** based on the behavior of others. This is relevant in AI for scenarios like:

- **Multi-agent learning:** Where multiple AI agents interact and make decisions (e.g., self-driving cars coordinating at an intersection).
- **Strategic decision-making:** AI playing games like chess or poker.
- **Economics and negotiation models:** Where agents (or companies) decide prices, production levels, or resource allocation.

A Nash equilibrium ensures that **no single agent can improve its performance** without others changing their strategies.

### Summary:

- **Definition:**  
    A Nash equilibrium occurs when each player’s strategy is the best response to everyone else’s strategies.
    
- **In simpler terms:**  
    It’s a situation where no one has an incentive to change their move because they are already doing the best they can, given what others are doing.
    
- **In AI:**  
    The concept is crucial for modeling how intelligent agents interact in environments where their decisions depend on one another. It ensures stability and optimal decision-making in competitive or cooperative settings.
