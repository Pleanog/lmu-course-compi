 >[!CITE] Definition 4 (population-based optimization)
 Let $\mathcal{X}$ be a state space. Let $\mathcal{T}$ be a target space with total order $\leq$. Let $\tau : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{T}$ be a target function. A tuple $\mathcal{E} = (\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{T}, \tau, E, \langle X_t \rangle_{0 \leq t \leq g})$ is a population-based optimization process iff $X_t \in \wp^(\mathcal{X})$ for all $t$ and $E : (\wp^(\mathcal{X})) \times (\mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{T}) \to \wp^*(\mathcal{X})$ is a possibly randomized, non-deterministic, or further parametrized function so that the population-based optimization run is produced by calling $E$ repeatedly, i.e., $X_{t+1} = E(\langle X_u \rangle_{0 \leq u \leq t}, \tau),$ where $X_0$ is given externally or chosen randomly.

## ELI5
Imagine you're trying to solve a puzzle with a group of friends (the population). Each friend represents a potential solution to the puzzle. Together, you compare everyone's ideas and decide how to improve as a group. After each round of brainstorming, the group evolves based on everyone's input, using both the current ideas and a strategy to improve. This iterative process of group improvement is population-based optimization.

### Components of the Definition

1. **State Space ($\mathcal{X}$):**
    Represents the set of all possible states or solutions.
2. **Target Space ($\mathcal{T}$):**
    Represents the set of all possible values of the target function $\tau$, ordered by $\leq$ (e.g., to minimize or maximize).
3. **Target Function ($\tau$):**
    Maps states in $\mathcal{X}$ to their corresponding target values in $\mathcal{T}$, indicating the quality of each state.
4. **Population ($\wp^*(\mathcal{X})$):**
    Refers to subsets of the state space $\mathcal{X}$, treated as a group of candidate solutions.
5. **Evolution Function ($E$):**
    Generates the next population $X_{t+1}$ based on the current sequence of populations $\langle X_u \rangle_{0 \leq u \leq t}$ and the target function $\tau$. It may involve randomness or other parameters.
6. Initialization ($X_0$):
    The initial population is either given externally or randomly chosen.

### Summary 
Population-based optimization uses groups of solutions (populations) to iteratively find better solutions. It employs an evolution function ($E$) to generate the next population based on current information and randomness.
