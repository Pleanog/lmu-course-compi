- $\mathcal{O}$ : Represents the observation space.
- 𝒜 : Represents the action space.
- ℝ: Real numbers, representing percentage changes.
- T: Often used for Timestamps for observations.
- × (Cartesian product): Combines sets to form tuples of all possible combinations.
- 𝜋 The policy function. Maps observations to actions. Example: `𝜋: O → A`
- $\pi(o)$ : represents the action that the agent should take when it observes $\mathcal{o}$  (an element of the observation space $\mathcal{O}$ .
- $\mathcal{y}$ : used to denote whether a particular goal or condition (such as "the environment is clean") has been achieved (true, or false / 1 or 0)
- $\mathcal{B}$ : The result of the function basically $\mathcal{y}$ 
- Z: The time space (timeline).  It is defining that the observations (𝑜ₜ) and actions (𝑎ₜ) happen over time.

- $\chi$: The Utility Function naps the combined actions of all agents ($\mathcal{A}$) to a reward or outcome in the joint target space $\mathcal{T}$. This utility measures how favorable the outcome is for the agents.
