>[!CITE] **Definition 20 (evolutionary stable strategy [2]).**  
Let $(G, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{T}, \chi)$ be a normal-form game played by two players $i,−i$ with the same action space $\mathcal{A}^{[i]} = \mathcal{A}^{[-i]}$. A strategy $\pi^{[i]}$ for agent $G^{[i]}$ is an **evolutionary stable strategy** $iff$:
> - $\pi = \pi^{[i]} \oplus \pi^{[-i]}$ with $\pi^{[-i]} = \pi^{[i]}$ is a Nash equilibrium, and
> - for every other strategy $\pi'^{[i]} = \pi'^{[-i]} \neq \pi^{[i]}$ it holds that $$\chi^{[i]}((\pi^{[i]} \oplus \pi'^{[-i]})(\cdot)) > \chi^{[i]}((\pi'^{[i]} \oplus \pi'^{[-i]})(\cdot))$$.

### ELI5

Imagine two players in a game where they can both choose a strategy. If one player finds a strategy that works so well that:
1. They don't want to change it if both players play the same strategy (this is the Nash equilibrium part).
2. If another player tries to switch to a slightly different strategy, the first player's strategy still performs better (this is the "stable" part).

Then the strategy is considered "evolutionarily stable." It’s like finding a winning move that beats others, even when someone tries something new.

### Explanation of Components

1. **Game Setup**:
    - $(G, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{T}, \chi)$ represents the game:
        - $G$: The players or agents in the game (e.g., two agents $i$ and $-i$).
        - $\mathcal{A}$: The set of possible actions (or strategies) the players can choose.
        - $\mathcal{T}$: The rules or dynamics of the game.
        - $\chi$: The payoff or utility function, which tells us how good an outcome is for each player.
2. **Nash Equilibrium Condition**:
    - $\pi = \pi^{[i]} \oplus \pi^{[-i]}$ means both players use the same strategy.
    - If this setup leads to a Nash equilibrium, neither player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.
3. **Stability Condition**:
    - If a player tries a different strategy $\pi'^{[i]}$, it performs worse when the other player sticks to the original strategy $\pi^{[-i]}$.
    - This ensures that the original strategy $\pi^{[i]}$ is stable even when faced with alternative strategies.
4. **Payoff Comparison**:
    - $\chi^{[i]}((\pi^{[i]} \oplus \pi^{[-i]})(\cdot))$ is the payoff the player gets using the stable strategy.
    - $\chi^{[i]}((\pi'^{[i]} \oplus \pi^{[-i]})(\cdot))$ is the payoff when switching to the alternative strategy.
    - The condition ensures the payoff for the original strategy is always higher.

### Explanation

This definition ties into AI when designing agents that learn to make decisions in multi-agent environments, like evolutionary algorithms or reinforcement learning. If agents evolve or adapt their strategies over time, you want to ensure they settle on strategies that are stable and optimal (in a Nash sense) under evolutionary pressures. An evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) guarantees robustness to small changes, ensuring the system won't destabilize if a few agents deviate.

For example, in a multi-agent simulation where agents evolve over time, a strategy that is both Nash and evolutionarily stable prevents oscillations or chaotic behaviors as agents explore their options.

### Summary

An **evolutionarily stable strategy** is a strategy that:
1. Forms a Nash equilibrium when everyone uses it.
2. Outperforms other alternative strategies even if one player deviates.
This concept is useful in both evolutionary biology and AI to ensure robust, adaptive, and optimal strategies in multi-agent systems.
