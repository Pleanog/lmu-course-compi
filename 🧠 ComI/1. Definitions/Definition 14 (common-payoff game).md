> [!CITE] **Definition 14 (common-payoff game)**:
A normal-form game $(G, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{T}, \chi)$ is a **common-payoff game** $iff$ for any two agents $G^{[i]}, G^{[j]}$ and for any joint action $a = (a^{[1]}, \ldots, a^{[N]}) \in \mathcal{A}$, it holds that $\chi^{[i]}(a) = \chi^{[j]}(a)$.

## ELI5

A **common-payoff game** is a special kind of game where all the players (agents) always share the exact same reward, no matter what actions they take. Imagine a group of rowers in a boat race. No matter how hard or soft each individual rows, they all win or lose together because their reward depends on the entire boat's performance. So, everyone gets the same score, and their success is fully tied to working together.

This is different from other games where each player might get a different reward based on their individual choices. In a common-payoff game, everyone is "in the same boat," literally and figuratively!

## Components of the Definition

1. **Normal-form Game $(G, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{T}, \chi)$**:  
    The underlying game framework, defined in [[Definition 13 (normal-form game)]]:
    - $G$: Set of agents (players).
    - $\mathcal{A}$: Space of joint actions.
    - $\mathcal{T}$: Joint target space.
    - $\chi$: Utility function mapping joint actions to rewards.
2. **Common Reward ($\chi^{[i]}(a) = \chi^{[j]}(a)$)**:  
    For any two agents $G^{[i]}$ and $G^{[j]}$ and any joint action $a$, the rewards they get from $\chi$ are always equal.
3. **Condition ($iff$)**:  
    This equality of rewards is the defining feature that makes a normal-form game a **common-payoff game**.

## Explanation

A **common-payoff game** is a highly coordinated form of game. Unlike general games where agents might have conflicting goals or individual rewards, here all agents' rewards are synchronized. No matter what any individual agent does, the reward $\chi$ is the same for everyone.

This means:

- There's no competition among agents.
- The only way to maximize the reward is through perfect coordination.
- All players benefit or lose together.

### Why Is This Useful?

Common-payoff games are often used to model situations where teamwork and collective effort are crucial. For example:

- Teams collaborating to achieve a shared goal.
- Robots working together to perform a task in a coordinated manner.

## Summary

A **common-payoff game** is a special type of normal-form game where all agents receive the exact same reward for any joint action, regardless of their individual contributions. It emphasizes teamwork, coordination, and shared outcomes.
