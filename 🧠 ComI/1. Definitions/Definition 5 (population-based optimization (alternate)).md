> [!CITE] Definition 5: population-based optimization (alternate)
> An optimization process $\mathcal{E} = (\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{T}, \tau, E, \langle X_t \rangle_{0 \leq t \leq g})$ is called population-based iff $\mathcal{X}$ has the form $\mathcal{X} = \wp^*(\mathcal{Y})$ for some other state space $\mathcal{Y}$.

## ElI5
Think of the group of friends solving the puzzle. In this version, the group itself is treated as a single unit, and every "state" represents the whole group's collective ideas. Instead of focusing on individual friends, we consider the group as the building block for finding the solution.

### Components of the Definition

1. Alternate Form of $\mathcal{X}$:
	In population-based optimization, the state space $\mathcal{X}$ must be expressible as $\wp^*(\mathcal{Y})$, indicating that each state is a collection of elements from some underlying state space $\mathcal{Y}$.

### Summary
The alternate definition formalizes population-based optimization as treating the state space $\mathcal{X}$ itself as groups (populations) derived from another state space $\mathcal{Y}$.
