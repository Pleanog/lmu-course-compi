Furthermore, for values $v_i$: $$(v_{0, \ldots, N-1}) \preceq (v'_{0, \ldots, N-1}) \iff \forall i \in [0; N-1] : v_i \leq v'_i$$
where: $$ v_i = \tau_i(x),$$
and: $$$v'_i = \tau_i(x')$$

#### ELI5:

If we were trying to optimize multiple things at the same time, like making a car both faster and more fuel-efficient, we run into the problem, that sometimes, what makes the car faster might make it less fuel-efficient. This definition explains how to handle these trade-offs by considering all goals (or objectives) together. Instead of saying "this is the best car overall," we compare each goal (e.g., speed and efficiency) separately and find compromises that work well for all goals.

#### Explanation of Components:

1. **$\mathcal{E}$: Optimization Process**
    - $\mathcal{E}$ refers to the entire system used for optimizing some objectives. This includes:
        - $\mathcal{X}$: The set of possible solutions (search space).
        - $\mathcal{T}$: The target space, representing the objectives we want to optimize.
        - $\tau$: A function that evaluates solutions and maps them to their objective values.
2. **$\mathcal{T}$: Target Space**
    - This is split into multiple dimensions: $\mathcal{T}_0, \ldots, \mathcal{T}_{N-1}$. Each dimension corresponds to one optimization objective (e.g., speed, efficiency).
3. **Total and Partial Orders ($\leq_i$ and $\preceq$):**
    - $\leq_i$: Defines a total order for each objective. For example, one car can be definitively faster than another.
    - $\preceq$: Combines these total orders into a partial order to compare solutions across all objectives. For example, one car might be faster but less efficient, so it's not entirely "better."
4. **$\tau_i(x)$: Objective Function**
    - $\tau_i(x)$ measures how well a solution $x$ performs for the $i$-th objective.
5. **Comparison Rule ($\preceq$):**
    - Two solutions are compared by checking all objectives. One solution is better if it’s at least as good in every objective and better in at least one.

### Explanation:

Multi-objective optimization deals with solving problems that have multiple conflicting goals. In AI and machine learning, this is common when balancing trade-offs, such as accuracy versus computation time or precision versus recall in classification tasks.

The definition formalizes how solutions can be evaluated when optimizing for multiple objectives. Instead of finding a single "best" solution, it establishes a framework for comparing solutions based on their performance across all objectives. This is critical in problems where improving one metric might degrade another, such as resource allocation or hyperparameter tuning.

### Summary:

Multi-objective optimization is a method to handle problems with multiple goals that may conflict. It splits the target space into objectives, each with its own criteria for evaluation. The definition provides a way to compare solutions by constructing a partial order from individual objective comparisons, ensuring that trade-offs are properly managed. This approach is fundamental in AI for tasks that require balancing competing metrics
